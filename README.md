## Calculator Project
# Overview
This project is a Java-based calculator designed to handle various mathematical calculations efficiently. It uses custom data structures and algorithms such as stacks, linked lists, and cursor arrays to process and evaluate expressions. One of its key features is support for postfix (reverse Polish) notation, which makes calculations easier and faster.
The calculator uses a stack to manage the calculations. It pushes numbers onto the stack and applies operators to these numbers in a systematic way. This approach ensures accurate and quick computations, making the calculator both powerful and user-friendly.

# Features
1- Custom Data Structures: Implements stacks, linked lists, and cursor arrays for efficient data handling and computation.

2- Postfix Expression Evaluation: Utilizes postfix notation for streamlined expression evaluation.

3- Stack-Based Calculation: Processes postfix expressions by pushing operands onto a stack and applying operators systematically, ensuring accurate and efficient calculations.
